# Project

This is a simple game I made with SDL 2.0 in order to learn how to use this library.

It was completed in 2 days, start to finish, which partly explains the low quality of
the code, but this project was just meant for me to learn SDL 2.0.

Here is a small demo of the game:

You may use this however you wish.
